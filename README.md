# registry-ng-template

You can use the `shadcn-ng` CLI to run your own component registry. Running your own
component registry allows you to distribute your custom components, services, pages, and
other files to any Angular project.

## Getting Started

This is a template for creating a custom registry using [Analog](https://analogjs.org/).

- The template uses a `registry.json` file to define components and their files.
- The `shadcn-ng build` command is used to build the registry.
- The registry items are served as static files under `public/r/[name].json`.
- Every registry item are compatible with the `shadcn-ng` CLI.
